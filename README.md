## PxAPI
It's library provides convinient access to the 500px.com from a java apps.
Please, read [developer guide](http://developers.500px.com) from 500px team to understand all opportunities and limites.

Also, you need to know how do OAuth2 work. I suggest to read [this article](http://hueniverse.com/oauth/)

I have not write documentation yet, but you can see test case - there are a few examples.

## Requirements
 - google-gson
 - signpost-common

This two libs is required. `google-gson` to parse api responses and `signpost-common` to sign oauth requests.
It's your concern to get access token and token secret or consumer secret from 500px.

## TODO
 - add a short examples 
 - add wiki
